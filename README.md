# nakabo

Welcome to *nakabo* - a collection of neatly designed breakout boards aimed at simplifying development and experimentation.

Feel free to give me a shoutout [@kiu112](https://twitter.com/kiu112) - I would love to see how my [#nakabo](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2523nakabo) boards are being used in your projects.

* All pins routed out to headers / sockets
* AVR6 IDC connector (6P 2x03 2.54mm / 100mil) for UPDI programming and debugging
* Major pin functions documented on front silkscreen
* 2.54mm / 100mil breadboard compatible spacing
* Dedicated reset button
* [FT232RL module](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=FT232RL+module) compatible pin socket for easy serial interfacing

Disclaimer: These are not plug and play development boards - you need an UPDI compatible programmer to use them. There is no protection (e.g. reverse polarity), handle with care.
